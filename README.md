# The Memory Quest

The Memory Quest was created when we participated in Manas Codeathon 2023 organized by CDAC. 
We were given with the problem statement to create a game to enhance the Cognitive skill-Attention of the player.
First of all user must sign up/ login to the page. 
Then the game starts when user will be presented numbers whose digits will disappear one by one. When all the digits are disappeared the 4 options will be displayed and the user must choose the number which was displayed before. At the end the performance of the user is displayed.
This game comes with varying levels of difficulty. 3 levels of difficulty are implemented.
Leaderboard will display the participants list and Personal Best Leaderboard displays the users score in 3 levels.
